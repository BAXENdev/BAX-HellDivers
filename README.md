I am creating my version of HellDivers strategems from code used with a [Public Server Zeus composition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRI8yca1Ozk)
More documentation on the way.

My skills are scripting. Almost all models and textures are sourced from the two mods listed above. A huge thanks to them for open sourcing their mods.

## _**PLANNED FEATURES**_
* A strategem system for adding, removing, and calling in fire or friendly supports
* 3den modules for adding custom supports
* Drone and robot based enemies and factions
* (Possibly) Mission Generator Modules
